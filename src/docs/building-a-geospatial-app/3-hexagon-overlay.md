# Add a Hexagon Overlay with Deck.GL
[View code](https://github.com/uber-common/vis-academy/tree/master/src/demos/building-a-geospatial-app/3-hexagon-overlay)

**NOTE** This step follows from the **completed** code of the previous section,
[Scatterplot Overlay](#/building-a-geospatial-app/2-scatterplot-overlay.md).

`Scatterplot` can plot raw points, but to visualize distribution of these
points, we need a layer that can aggregate points into a geo grid.
`HexagonLayer` and `GridLayer` are both aggregation layers that
can visualize a distribution heatmap from raw points.

## 1. Update our control panel
We're going to upgrade our control panel so we can switch from the scatterplot layer to the hexagon layer. Let's do that now, so you can see the changes on the hexagon layer as we build it.

Replace SCATTERPLOT_CONTROLS with HEXAGON_CONTROLS everywhere in app.js. It appears 4 times:
- in the import statement,
- in the component's contructor method, while preparing the initial state,
- in the render method, as an argument to the LayerControls component.

Now, to implement our new overlay, let's focus on `deckgl-layers.js`:

## 2. Add Constants for Hexagon Layer

Deck.gl performantly shallow compares on layer props to decide how to update attribute buffer.
To avoid unnecessary re-calculations, we define constant params outside of the render function.

You can add these constants at the very top of `deckgl-overlay.js`.
We will pass them into the `HexagonLayer` later on.

```js
// in RGB

const HEATMAP_COLORS = [
  [255, 255, 204],
  [199, 233, 180],
  [127, 205, 187],
  [65, 182, 196],
  [44, 127, 184],
  [37, 52, 148]
];

const LIGHT_SETTINGS = {
  lightsPosition: [-73.8, 40.5, 8000, -74.2, 40.9, 8000],
  ambientRatio: 0.4,
  diffuseRatio: 0.6,
  specularRatio: 0.2,
  lightsStrength: [0.8, 0.0, 0.8, 0.0],
  numberOfLights: 2
};

const elevationRange = [0, 1000];
```

## 3. Add Hexagon Layer

We have already passed the necessary data into this component in the previous example. So now we only need to take care of rendering the `HexagonLayer` when needed.

```js
// ...
import {ScatterplotLayer, HexagonLayer} from 'deck.gl';

// ...

export function renderLayers(props) {
  const { data, onHover, settings } = props;
  return [
    settings.showScatterplot &&
      new ScatterplotLayer({
        id: 'scatterplot',
        getPosition: d => d.position,
        getColor: d => (d.pickup ? PICKUP_COLOR : DROPOFF_COLOR),
        getRadius: d => 5,
        opacity: 0.5,
        pickable: true,
        radiusMinPixels: 0.25,
        radiusMaxPixels: 30,
        data,
        onHover,
        ...settings
      }),
    settings.showHexagon &&
      new HexagonLayer({
        id: 'heatmap',
        colorRange: HEATMAP_COLORS,
        elevationRange,
        elevationScale: 5,
        extruded: true,
        getPosition: d => d.position,
        lightSettings: LIGHT_SETTINGS,
        opacity: 0.8,
        pickable: true,
        data,
        onHover,
        ...settings
      })
  ];
}
```

With this, your `deckgl-overlay.js` should be ready to render a functional `HexagonLayer`.

Here's a link to the [complete code of this step](https://github.com/uber-common/vis-academy/tree/master/src/demos/building-a-geospatial-app/hexagon-overlay)

<ul class="insert takeaways">
  <li>The HexagonLayer can display aggregated, 3D hexagons</li>
  <li>Deck.GL can display any number of layers at once</li>
  <li>It's possible to deactivate any of these layers at runtime by returning null instead of a layer</li>
</ul>

[Deck.gl documentation of Hexagon Layer](https://uber.github.io/deck.gl/#/layer-catalog/hexagon-layer)

Let's go over some properties of the `HexagonLayer` above:

##### `data` {Array}
Array of points for the layer. In this case, it's our Taxi data set.
format as `[{position: [lng, lat]}, {position: [lng, lat]}]`

##### `getPosition` {Function}
Function that gets called on each data point, should return an array of [longitude, latitude].

##### `extruded` {Bool}
Whether to enable hexagon elevation

#### `radius` {Number}
Hexagon layer cell radius in meters

#### `upperPercentile` {Number} (Default: `100`)
Hexagon cells with value larger than upperPercentile will be hidden

##### `pickable` {Bool}
Indicates whether this layer should be interactive.
