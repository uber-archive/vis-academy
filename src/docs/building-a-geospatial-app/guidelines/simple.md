# Do: clear simple charts

Data visualization gives you the power of turning a dataset into something visual, but a chart is more than a series of marks. 

<!-- INJECT:"GeospatialAppDontSimpleChart" -->

The chart above is an example of that - it's correct, but doesn't provide enough information to understand what's going on. 

For the chart to be useful, it needs context.

<!-- INJECT:"GeospatialAppLessSimpleChart" -->

This chart starts making more sense, but it's still not clear enough for someone who doesn't know what it's about.

<!-- INJECT:"GeospatialAppChartWithContext" -->

This chart has a title, axes description and a source. Now it's clearer. Not all charts need this degree of detail, but something as simple as a title can dispell ambiguity and avoid misinterpretation.
